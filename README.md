# AI Survivor-Style Game

And I game dev expriment. Implementing a simple Brotato-style game using bitECS and PixiJS. Attempting to implement as hands-off as possible.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed
2. Run `bun install` to install dependencies
3. Run `bun start` to start the development server
4. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000)

## Prompt History

- Conversations
	- [Baseline](./conversation/conversation-1-44378ec.md)
		- Before the prompt, I basically just ran `bun init` and added `bitECS` and `pixi.js`.

			This was just setting the basic movement. I'd actually tried this a few times and kept coming up with..._interesting_ results. I finally decided to go ahead and start with a hair more direction. This included overcoming some stale knowledge that it consistently tripped over regarding the initialization of a Pixi app.
